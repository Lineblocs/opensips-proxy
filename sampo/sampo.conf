# build.sh only cares about the vars as the other functions will not be found from the build script
# sampo.sh will source this file in order to respond to user-defined endpoints

    # You can configure sampo by modifying sampo.conf
    #
    # This config file is mainly for defining endpoints a client will use
    # You can add any arbitrary shell code here, but it's usually easier
    # to define only your endpoints the functions they should call here
    # Those functions and any custom ones should be added to sampo.sh
    #
    # Rules usage line:
    #    match_uri REGEX command [args]
    #
    # match_uri:
    #   On an incoming request, the URI is checked against the regex.
    #   If one is found, the specified command is executed with the specified arguments.
    #
    #   This function will also pass the results of the regex match,
    #   ${BASH_REMATCH[@]} as additional arguments to the command.
    #
    # If you don't pass anything, this will list all of the endpints you have defined.
    # This is useful for debugging when making your own endpoints and functions,
    # but it just shows how you can make a function in shell code in sampo.sh
    # and use the match_uri to run some arbitrary shell code
    # This also serves as an easy way for your end-users to see the available endpoints and their functions by simply calling the root of the API
    #match_uri '^/$' list_endpoints

    # The /file endpoint returns the content of the file specified in the URI
    #match_uri '^/file/(.*)$' serve_file

   # The /dir endpoint returns the output of a dir using ls
    #match_uri '^/dir/(.*)$' serve_dir_with_ls

    # Probably the most useful to end-users is the ability to call any arbitrary scripts
    # Here, we match an '/example' endpoint and then run a script residing on the server
    #match_uri '^/example$' run_external_script "${SAMPO_BASE}"/scripts/example.sh

    match_uri '^/reload_rtpproxies$' run_external_script "${SAMPO_BASE}"/scripts/reload_rtpproxies.sh

    # Often, your custom scripts will not output JSON and JSON alone, so it is not easy for clients to consume the output
    # To that end, here are a few examples of how you could write shell code, but return JSON
    # It's not always pretty, but it can work
    # For the most resiliency, your scripts should be highly critical of STDOUT, STDERR, exit codes, and edge cases
    # If your script returns one faulty character, it can break the entire JSON payload
    
    # This one uses printf to hand-craft some variables into a paylod
    # It returns two enviornment variables so you can determine the OS and the version of bash running on the server
    #match_uri '^/jsonsimple$' run_external_script "${SAMPO_BASE}"/scripts/json_simple.sh

    # This parses some output, and turns it into a list
    # It takes a signifigant amount of data, does some processing, and then returns a list
    # This allows things on the server to be easily available in list form to the client
    #match_uri '^/jsonlist$' run_external_script "${SAMPO_BASE}"/scripts/json_list.sh

    # this parses the 'ls' command and makes a detailed dict payload
    # ls returns quite a bit of data, and this is a good example of how to parse that data
    # it converts each entry into a dict, and then returns a list of dicts
    # the client can then easily parse the data however they want
    # this is a good example of how to parse a complex set of data and return it in a useful way
    #match_uri '^/jsoncomplex$' run_external_script "${SAMPO_BASE}"/scripts/json_complex.sh

    #
    # Create your own endpoints below
    # 
    # sampo is designed to be as drop-in as possible
    # to get started, you need a folder on a server somewhere that has:
    #    - sampo.sh
    #    - sampo.conf
    #    - scripts/
    #
    # just dump all of your custom scripts into the scripts folder
    # and then they will be accessible to you to create endpoints
    # 
    #
    # match_uri '^/custom$' run_external_script "${SAMPO_BASE}"/scripts/yourscript.sh
    #
    # You can also write shell code directly in this config by creating functions
    # and then creating a match_uri to go with it
    # your function must be defined before the match_uri that calls it
    # while not as clean, this can be useful for simple endpoints
    # but it is usually easier to only define your endpoints here
    #
    # an example of an endpoint that returns arbitrary text:
    #
    # rusty_fork() {
    #    append_header "Content-Type" "text/plain"
    #    # calling curl http://localhost:1042/fork/done will echo the text:
    #    #     "stick a rusty fork in me, I am done"
    #    send_response 200 <<< "Stick a rusty fork in me, I am $2"
    # }
    # # A simple echo endpoint to returns arbitrary text with a given argument
    # match_uri '^/fork/(.*)$' \
    #   rusty_fork
